        The group PSY LOAD was formed in 2019. Sergey Senin (G.S.T) and Danila
        Khorikov (Denny), against the background of accumulated ideas, poems and
        music, decided to try to play together. It all started in a small
        provincial town, despite the metropolitan origin of both participants.
        G.S.T's poetry and Denny's deep thought processes, combined with
        different musical interests in genres and styles of music, gave rise to
        the team's own traditions.

      <p>
        The group has never been guided by any style or genre of music, we try
        to adhere to a free style, but as always happens, we, regardless of our
        preferences, have formed our own little musical world without boundaries
        and rules for existence.

        The band originates from lyrics written by G.S.T and music composed by
        both members of the band. The texts contain a deep character and
        multifaceted perception of our world. We believe in the presence of
        parallel worlds and do not exclude different developments of events at
        the same time. We don't sing songs about relationships, but we believe
        in sincere love, without definitions. We do not remain indifferent to
        everything that happens in the world and share our perception of the
        current circumstances in our songs. Psychological loading is a way to
        reflect on the deep meaning of LIFE in the universe, its forms and
        parallel worlds in which it is formed by a particle of the Universe.

        It was like this for exactly a year, until in 2020, we met Maxim Gunbin,
        a talented sound engineer, DJ and drummer. His wide range of musicians,
        interests and talents allowed us to bring new sounds to the compositions
        and realize some of Denny's crazy ideas. The descriptions for the tracks
        contain information about the origin of the sound and the ideas behind
        its birth. Nikolai Simbirtsev, with his solo, decorated the groupâ€™s
        tracks and made an invaluable contribution to their sound, and most
        importantly, was able to convey the atmosphere of the underlying
        meaning. Thanks to our artist Badi, we were able to place on the covers
        of our tracks a visual perception of the stories that we share in our
        songs. In 2022, we begin working in CSP studio and improving our sound,
        but later return to SECOND WAVE studio to complete work on the album. In
        2023, by the will of the Universe, we begin to work with Alexander
        VAVEEXPLORER and today we are happy to present a video of our work. We
        wish everyone peace. Welcome to our world of limitless thoughts.
